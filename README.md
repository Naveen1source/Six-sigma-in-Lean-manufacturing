# Six Sigma Process Improvement in Manufacturing

## Project Summary

This project demonstrates how to implement Six Sigma methodologies for process improvement across several manufacturing industries, using the structured DMAIC framework (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control).

We analyzed and optimized processes in:

* Tire manufacturing
* Rubber gloves production
* Steel bar manufacturing

Key goals of the project:

* Reduce defects and scrap rates
* Improve process stability and capability
* Lower operational costs
* Enhance product quality and customer satisfaction

Through real-world case studies and statistical tools like DOE (Design of Experiments), control charts, and regression modeling, the project shows measurable gains in process efficiency and quality levels.

This work directly aligns with professional roles in:

* Process Engineering
* Manufacturing Engineering
* Quality Assurance
* Six Sigma and Lean Implementation
* Continuous Improvement
* Industrial Engineering
* Operations Management


##  Tools & Techniques

* Six Sigma DMAIC methodology
* Design of Experiments (DOE)
* Statistical analysis (e.g., ANOVA)
* Minitab (for statistical plots and analysis)
* Pareto analysis
* Control charts
* Process capability indices (Cp, Cpk, Ppk)
* Regression modeling
* Root cause analysis (Fishbone/Ishikawa diagrams)
